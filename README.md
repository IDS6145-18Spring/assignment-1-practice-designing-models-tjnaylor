# Assignment 2 - Data Analysis and Visualization (Template)

## General Introduction
Data analysis and data visualization is key to both the input and output of simulations. This assignment explores different random number generators, distributions, visualizations, and statistics. Additionally, it will look at getting you accustomed to specifying input and output variables to a system. We will also practice working with real data.

## Part 1 - Plotting 2D Random Number Generators

(Briefly introduce what we are looking at)
(Add your plots here - 10 different subplots for 2 different generators and 5 Ns. )
(Talk about how the patterns differ.)

## Part 2 - Plotting 2D Random Number Distributions

(Briefly introduce what we are looking at)
(Add your plots here - 25 different subplots for 5 different generators and 5 Ns. )
(Talk about how the patterns differ.)

## Part 3 - Specifying the Inputs to a System


(remove the below points, here as reminder what to answer)
* Briefly remind us what the system was (object diagram, short description)
* Specify the independent and dependent input variables
* Specify where the data will come from measured subset of real data (empirical) or synthetic data
* What kind of statistics are important to capture this input data
* What are the output variables of your system?
* What useful statistics will you use to analyze the output?
* What ways will you visualize your data - charts, and graphs you will create?
* What clever way will you visualize your output with a useful infographic?


## Part 4 - Real Data

(Add your plots and visualization here)
(Put your data into the data directory)


* Write up a paragraph that describes the data and how it fits into your system.
* Load the data into Python
* Calculate a few useful statistic on the data - keep it simple- STD, means, etc..., this is just designed * to get used to working with real data. Explain the insights you derive from these statistics.
* Visualize the raw data - visualize a few critical aspects of the data to better describe what it is, what it is showing, and why its useful to your system.
* Calculate and plot some summary statistics that better describe the data.
