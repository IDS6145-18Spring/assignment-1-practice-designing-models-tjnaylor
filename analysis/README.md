## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation


Although I chose Anylogic, any simulation that incorporates agents would more than likely be sufficient to simulate the smart meter but I chose Anylogic because of it is simplicity. It is also a cost-effective way to simulate the Smart Meter because it is free for students and has the capability to simulate pedestrian and road traffic. 

I would conduct the Smart Meter simulation by modeling the flow of vehicle traffic and pedestrians to identify the Smart Meter usage. Next, I would model the flow of the pedestrians to the Smart Meter to identify the capacity of the Smart Meter at a given location.

The Smart Meter will collect data on the following items:
1.	Parking availability (vacant/occupied)
2.	Maintenance Status
3.	Charging status
4.	Payment method usage
